A new company has developed a breakthrough **Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG)**. An MMORPG is a computer game played over the Internet, connecting to a server where other players from around the world are also playing the same game. It is possible to **see** and communicate with these other players when online.

The database will manage the accounts of all players registered for this online game.

Each account must have a **unique name**, which players use to log on to the game server.

Players need to pay a monthly fee for having an account. When their subscription expires, the account must be **blocked** and can only be **unblocked** when more time is purchased.

Each account has multiple characters created by the user. All characters have names, belong to a team, and have a skill level.

A table in the database logs any errors that occur. Certain errors have specific types to make them easier to find.

While playing the game with a character, a player may find and pick up items. These items are stored in the character's inventory. Items are **not unique**, so other characters may have the same item. The inventory has **eight open slots** for different types of items. Items of the same type can stack in the same slot; therefore, a record of the **quantity** must be kept.
